## Goal 

This project aims to implement a simple client that adheres to 
the specification contained in Nostr's NIP-0, which is the most
basic format of the protocol.

My goal is to implement all the validation required for events
to be properly sent to relays and creating a proper interface
that allows any user to participate on the social network.
